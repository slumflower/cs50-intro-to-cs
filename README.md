# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

This repository was made to post my past solutions to Harvard University's CS50 2018 coursework.

This course is available on <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science"> edX</a>, however coursework has changed over the last couple of years. 

Each problem set has already been submitted into CS50's IDE

An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.
